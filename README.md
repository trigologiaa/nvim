# nvim

This is a config I am going to use, for now, to code in Go language... my aim is
to expand this config to work with multiple languages I have learned from
college (and I will possibly learn) in the future.

I use the nightly version on Arch Linux + Hyprland, so if someone uses this, it could break if
something is different.

I do not remember all the programs I have installed to work with. I will update this (I hope).

## Reasons

Initially this configuration is designed to work with the languages that I use in the subjects in
which I am a teaching assistant at the college, and with some luck, to be able to use it to work
with said languages.

I also try to stay away from LazyVim as a configuration, since there are things that do not quite
work for me in the way I like it.

## Dependencies

Everyone have their own OS so you have to look up how to install this list of programs if you want
to have everything working.

This config uses the following programs (for now I only remember one):

- fzf
